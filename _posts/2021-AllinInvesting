# Introduction

Over the past two years I have been reading and investing a lot. So, the main reason for this change is just by reading Jack bogle's book “The little book on common sense investing”. This book gave up phenomenal overview about owning stocks and what will be the returns look like in next 10, 20, 30 years. 

Eventually, I read a book called “Joy of compounding” this gave me the whole new idea/concept of value investing. I came to know about great value investors like Mr. Buffett, Mr. Munger, Mr. Pabrai, Mr Greenblatt and then I started cloning the highest conviction ideas from them and hold them for a while. 
This plain and simple approach taught me how to read a business and how to understand a business (think about the business) and little bit about the valuation. 

Though, I don't make up decent valuation enough quite yet. But I always looked up how much leverage the company has by reading the cash flow statement. Classical example would be the Tesla - I passed on. 
Since 2018 March or December exactly my entire portfolio is up 22 percentage. Being 60% on stock and 40% on index fund. I could find a lot of quality names and add based on high conviction, but this cloning approach works only to in certain extent which, I fear. 
Without having a solid understanding of accounting or reading financial statements and doing a decent valuation. 

I'm afraid, I cannot make big compounding.
Hence, this blog is created for every knew investors, who doesn't have any idea about investing to learn about accounting , valuation and assessing the management quality. Let's begin
